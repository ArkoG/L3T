Perhaps also Tengri, as there were also Turkish and Caucasian slaves in the CK2 period. Another slaves of high demand were the Saqaliba, that is the Slavs.
But the Slavs were the case only until central Europe was christianized (by the 10th century) and for the Turks the situation also changed after their islamization in 11th century.

So it is hard to define. Either religious definition as West African, Tengri and Slavic, or cultural, which would be little more cultures (African: Mande, Wolof, Hausa, Kanuri, Zaghawa, Daju, and possibly also Soninke and Songhay; Turkic: Turkish and other which will be defined later (as the Turkish cultures are being overhauled); and Slavic: Bohemian, Moravian (?-are already christian), Polish, Croat, Serb)
