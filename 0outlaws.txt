OUTLAWS TODO LIST
- Succession, the successor is choosen in order
	-> Legitimated heir (WARNING he can be titled, ...)
	-> A courtier
	-> A created character
- Manage the attack (or other actions) against the installed outlaws (same as no-installed outlaws?)
	-> The outlaws have an event to attack the baronnies if they are not in war (only cities and temple? even the province capital?)
	-> The barony have for 1 year the modifier looted = -20% d'or OR bloodshed = -20% troupes
		> Add a probability of building destruction? Typically 5%?
	-> The owner of the province received an event informing it
		> Loss of prestige (or piety if it is a temple)
		> If he decided to do nothing (choice or in war), he also lost opinion with the baron (5 years)
	-> The province owner decided to act
		> Send army (i.e declare war)
		> Send spys to assassinate the leader
		> Send spys to confuse the outlaws
- Scoring for the outlaw power
	-> Increasing
		> At the beginning
		> Duration/time
		> Build new buildings
		> Succession
		> Looting (and other events)
	-> Decreasing
		> Events
		> Succession
	-> If so few power => disapearing
	-> If so great power => feodal leader/mercenary band
- Change outlaw portrait (interface/portrait_properties but incompatible)
- Make intervention during summer feast (see Robin Hood in legends_events)
- Make intervention during great tournament (see Robin Hood in legends_events)
- Events for pirates in provinces with trade post (see republic_trade_events)
	-> apply it for both trade post and province owners
	-> see gitl3tsynchro for examples (9th January)
- Add jobs for fight outlaws (Bad Idea? IA will used it?)
	-> add text to existing jobs
	-> do events with these jobs
- Add an ambition to expel outlaws
	-> events chains
- Increase prestige of the outlaw expulsion
- Forbid the resource progression when outlaws are in the province (Wait update of the resources)
- Use Cases Belli dejure_barony_claim to declare war

TEST TODO
- How the IA manage the outlaws
	-> Now there is no management (i.e wait death and no successor)
- Have outlaws, wait 2 years (or more), kill the leader (several times if needed in order to have no successor), have new outlaws

BUG
- Decision to have full quantity of troops for the outlaw
	-> Scenario : 1)Have outlaws 2)Remove them rapidly 3)Have new outlaws

POTENTIAL BUG (i.e to investigate)
XYLO.02120 and XYLO.02121 have not exactly the same triggers
In some case, if we choose to do something, the failure is impossible.
=> I think 
	NOT = { owner = { any_demesne_province = { has_province_modifier = bandits_installes }}}
will be replaced by
	NOT = { has_province_modifier = bandits_installes }
