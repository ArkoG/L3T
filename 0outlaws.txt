OUTLAWS TODO LIST
- Manage the attack of the installed outlaws
- See the events of end of outlaws (XYLO.0217*)
- Change outlaw portrait (interface/portrait_properties but incompatible) OR put in DUKE
- Make intervention during summer feast (see Robin Hood in legends_events)
- Make intervention during great tournament (see Robin Hood in legends_events)
- Test the case of war victory (the king title disapear?)
- Add jobs for fight outlaws
	-> add text to existing jobs
	-> do events with these jobs
- Add an ambition to expel outlaws
	-> events chains

TEST TODO
- How the IA manage the outlaws
	-> Declare war? Apparently not
- Try with an Emperor : the outlaw is his vassal?
	-> Suggestion give to the outlaw, the title of owner of the province
- Have outlaws, wait 2 years (or more), kill the leader (several times if needed in order to have no successor), have new outlaws
	
BUGS
- Domain specialization events
- Province moreless owned by the outlaws : we see it in the event picture (only when his title is greater than the real province owner?)
	-> owner = { } is the outlaw?
