OUTLAWS TODO LIST
- Prevent outlaw to become
	> Commandant
	> Councillor
- Manage the attack of the installed outlaws
- See the events of end of outlaws (XYLO.0217*) => merge
	=> TEST with no buildings removal then the holding building (see if the outlaws buildings are there)
- Change outlaw portrait (interface/portrait_properties but incompatible) OR put in DUKE
- Make intervention during summer feast (see Robin Hood in legends_events)
- Make intervention during great tournament (see Robin Hood in legends_events)
- Test the case of war victory (the king title disapear?)
- Events for pirates in provinces with trade post (see republic_trade_events)
	-> apply it for both trade post and province owners
	-> see gitl3tsynchro for examples
- Add jobs for fight outlaws
	-> add text to existing jobs
	-> do events with these jobs
- Add an ambition to expel outlaws
	-> events chains
- Increase prestige of the outlaw expulsion
- Forbid the resource progression when outlaws are in the province
- Use Cases Belli dejure_barony_claim to declare war

TEST TODO
- How the IA manage the outlaws
	-> Declare war? Apparently not
- Have outlaws, wait 2 years (or more), kill the leader (several times if needed in order to have no successor), have new outlaws
	
BUGS (with Outlaw as King and independant rulers)
- Province moreless owned by the outlaws : we see it in the event picture (only when his title is greater than the real province owner?)
	-> owner = { } is the outlaw?
	-> Suggestion give to the outlaw, the title of owner of the province
- In Pomeranie, the pagan Duke gain the Outlaw King Title
	=> Outlaws come back to vassals

POTENTIAL BUG (i.e to investigate)
XYLO.02120 and XYLO.02121 have not exactly the same triggers
In some case, if we choose to do something, the failure is impossible.
=> I think 
	NOT = { owner = { any_demesne_province = { has_province_modifier = bandits_installes }}}
will be replaced by
	NOT = { has_province_modifier = bandits_installes }
