OUTLAWS TODO LIST
- Prevent outlaw to become
	> Councillor
- Manage the attack (or other actions) against the installed outlaws (same as no-installed outlaws?)
- See the events of end of outlaws (XYLO.0217*) => merge
	=> TEST with no buildings removal then the holding building (see if the outlaws buildings are there)
- Change outlaw portrait (interface/portrait_properties but incompatible)
- Make intervention during summer feast (see Robin Hood in legends_events)
- Make intervention during great tournament (see Robin Hood in legends_events)
- Events for pirates in provinces with trade post (see republic_trade_events)
	-> apply it for both trade post and province owners
	-> see gitl3tsynchro for examples
- Add jobs for fight outlaws (Bad Idea? IA will used it?)
	-> add text to existing jobs
	-> do events with these jobs
- Add an ambition to expel outlaws (Wait 2.5)
	-> events chains
- Increase prestige of the outlaw expulsion
- Forbid the resource progression when outlaws are in the province (Wait update of the resources)
- Use Cases Belli dejure_barony_claim to declare war

TEST TODO
- How the IA manage the outlaws
	-> Declare war? Apparently not
- Have outlaws, wait 2 years (or more), kill the leader (several times if needed in order to have no successor), have new outlaws

POTENTIAL BUG (i.e to investigate)
XYLO.02120 and XYLO.02121 have not exactly the same triggers
In some case, if we choose to do something, the failure is impossible.
=> I think 
	NOT = { owner = { any_demesne_province = { has_province_modifier = bandits_installes }}}
will be replaced by
	NOT = { has_province_modifier = bandits_installes }
