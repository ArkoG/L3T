OUTLAWS TODO LIST
- Manage the attack (or other actions) against the installed outlaws (same as no-installed outlaws?)
	-> The outlaws have an event to attack the baronnies if they are not in war (only cities and temple? even the province capital?)
	-> The barony have for 1 year the modifier looted = -20% d'or OR bloodshed = -20% troupes
		> Add a probability of building destruction? Typically 5%?
	-> The owner of the province received an event informing it
		> Loss of prestige (or piety if it is a temple)
		> If he decided to do nothing (choice or in war), he also lost opinion with the baron (5 years)
- Scoring for the outlaw power
	-> Increasing
		> At the beginning
		> Duration/time
		> Looting (and other events like an attack during huntig)
	-> Decreasing
		> Events
	-> If so few power => disapearing
	-> If so great power => other action with bad effects
- Make wounded or killed by the bandit in the attack during hunting
- Change outlaw portrait (interface/portrait_properties but incompatible)
- Make intervention during summer feast (see Robin Hood in legends_events)
- Make intervention during great tournament (see Robin Hood in legends_events)
- Events for pirates in provinces with trade post (see republic_trade_events)
	-> apply it for both trade post and province owners
	-> see gitl3tsynchro for examples (9th January)
- Add an ambition to expel outlaws
	-> events chains
- Increase prestige of the outlaw expulsion (20-50 seems reasonnable)
- Forbid the resource progression when outlaws are in the province (Wait update of the resources)

TEST TODO
- How the IA manage the outlaws?
	
SLACK : gitl3tsynchro 9th January 2016
it would be cool to get a pirate holding made from a tradepost but it is impossible
maybe it could just be some random trade event like republics usualy get
ship attack, tavern fight, stolen goods...

For example
- pirates attacks => loss of ships => less money (instantly + modifier)
- pirates kidnapping => pay a ransom (edited)
- pirate raiding => destruction of a building

yes, and maybe a few ones that can affect a bit more durably the T_P

-goods stolen in our warehouse, gold loss
-a warehouse was burnt, gold loss + neg modifier (trade value or income%)
pirates raiding can target various things with various results :
-the TP garrison was attacked, garrison building loses one level
-burnt ship in harbour +  neg modifier (trade value or income%)
but also good issues like avoid pirate sabotage (intrigue gain)
etc.

[About avoid pirate sabotage]
nothing complex. maybe we could have :
-if low intrigue, you detect nothing >> sabotage occurs
-if medium intrigue >> you heard some rumors of a sabotage, giving some chances to avoid it
-if high intrigue >> you intercept some sabotage plans, giving some better chances to avoid it
-if you are an intrigue God >> you intercept the authors beforehand and hang them publicly (or something less cruel )
on the fly ideas
if you hang them it could also discourage furhter pirate actions or provicate something bigger
