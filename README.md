# Mod presentation

### What is it?

This mod aims to flesh out some economical mechanics for the game and bringing some more medieval flavour and immersion for us players.

### The name ?

The 3 towers are respectively the symbols of power of the main actors in CK2 : the dungeon for nobles, the steeple for clergy, the belfry for burghers.
Since this mod deals about those holding types and those important actors of medieval age, i found this name a good name. The original name is in French since i didn't really intended to share it here at first.

### Main features

Gameplay :
- Unique trade system with dynamic trade routes
- Ressources and economic system
- Settlement specializations

Flavour :
- forest themed (donation, buy/sell/forest charters, specializations...)
- economic themed (prosperity, crops, climate related event...)
- chronicles entries
- new increase skills ambition event chains (fabrics' sellings, the cadastre, the legendary sword)

Graphics :
- new graphics associated with the new features (a lot modifiers icons, event pictures etc. )

### Next ?
- the return of cathedrals with a brand new and better system, AI usable, with a lot of flavour stuff (loans, competition, artists...)
- completion of specialisation system
- flavour and even more flavour ! the return of bandits, mushroom hunt, new laws...

### Mod compability and recommendation

The mod is designed to work on both Vanilla and SWMH maps.
Playing with Arkopack modules is highly recommended. Arkopack CoA pack because it adds some features only active with SWMH, Arkopack Interface pack because some design choice (more space for modifiers and such) are though for L3T/T3T, some interface modifications were L3T exclusive and are now inherited by Arkopack.
NBRT+ is of course a must have. It is shipped through H.I.P alongside with SWMH.
To use L3T with HIP, don't install EMF.
